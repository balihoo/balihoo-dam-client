Balihoo DAM Client
==================

This package provides a simple SDK for managing assets in the Balihoo Digital Asset Manager (DAM).  The dam lives within the Form-Builder, and allows clients using local tools (such as [balihoo-creative|https://github.com/balihoo/balihoo-creative]) to upload assets needed for creatives to be hosted, indexed and searchable for use in those creatives.
  
Using the tool will require credentials to the form builder.
